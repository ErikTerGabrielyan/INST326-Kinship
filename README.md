Kinship was our second OOP project we were required to implement in INST326 - Python for Information Science.

Kinship is a program that can read in a dataset of individuals in a family and their parent and spouse connections, and determine how two people are related. Kinship contains two classes: Person (representing a person from the family data) and Family (which tracks all the people about whom you have relationship information).

family.json contains sample data to run the program with, and relationships.py contains the modules for familial relationships to be used inside of kinship.
